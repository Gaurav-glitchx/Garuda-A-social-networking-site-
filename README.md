Developed Garuda, a social networking platform inspired by X (formerly known as Twitter), with a focus on creating an engaging and interactive online community. The project aimed to provide users with a seamless experience for social interactions and content sharing.

#Key Features and Functionalities:

User Profiles: Designed and implemented user profiles where individuals can create and customize their personal information, including profile pictures, bios, and contact details. Profiles serve as the central hub for users to manage their activity and interactions.

Posts and Interactions: Enabled users to post updates, share content, and engage with others through likes, comments, and replies. The platform supports rich text formatting and multimedia content, enhancing the user experience and encouraging active participation.

Notifications: Developed a notification system to keep users informed about interactions, mentions, and updates related to their posts and connections. This feature helps users stay engaged and respond promptly to activities within their network.

Responsive Design: Utilized Bootstrap to ensure the platform is fully responsive and accessible across various devices and screen sizes. The responsive design ensures a consistent user experience whether accessed from desktops, tablets, or smartphones.

Database Management: Implemented MySQL for robust database management, handling user data, posts, interactions, and notifications efficiently. Designed the database schema to support scalable data storage and retrieval, ensuring quick and reliable performance.

Server-Side Processing: Leveraged PHP for server-side scripting to manage data processing, user authentication, and content management. The PHP backend handles business logic, session management, and interaction with the MySQL database, facilitating smooth and secure user operations.

#Development Approach:

The development of Garuda involved careful planning and execution of both frontend and backend components. The user interface was crafted to be intuitive and engaging, while the backend was designed to handle high traffic and data volumes efficiently. The project emphasized creating a user-friendly and interactive environment to foster community engagement and connectivity.

This project highlights my ability to integrate frontend design with backend functionality, utilizing modern web technologies to build a comprehensive and dynamic social networking platform.
